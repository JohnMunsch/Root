# Angular 2 Essentials

Code, links, and reference material for the Packt Publishing course 
*Angular 2 Essentials*.

## Where to find updates!

<https://github.com/JohnMunsch/Root>

## Important Notes!

*This source code is current with the rc.4 release of Angular 2.*

Each video gets its own directory for source. In most of those 
directories there is a start directory, which contains the source as 
it was at the start of the video before I add to it or make changes, 
and an end directory which corresponds to the final version of the code 
from the end of the video.

In each directory you will need to run "npm install" to install the Node.js
packages for that particular directory. You will also need to stop any "gulp" command
you have running in another directory.

**Note: This course was written in anticipation of Gulp v4 being 
released around the same time. As a result the package.json files 
install the pre-release version of Gulp v4. After v4 is released I'll come
back and update the package.json files appropriately.**

### TypeScript
- [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [TypeScript Playground](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play/index.html)
- [ES6 Compatability Table](https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/#typescript)

Example code for the TypeScript Playground:

    function greeter(person) {
        return `Hello, ${ person }`;
    }

    var user = "Jane User";

    document.body.innerHTML = greeter(user);

### Installation Steps
1. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

2. The command to install the global packages with NPM (please see the note at the top of this README about Gulp v4):
`npm install -g "gulpjs/gulp-cli" typescript`

3. cd to "Section 1/Video 1.4/start" and run `npm install`

This will install any local packages needed for this project into the node_modules directory.

Be sure you've already done all the installation from the previous video and then run:
`gulp`

## Further Learning

### ES6/ES2015
* [ES6 Katas](http://es6katas.org/) - One of my favorite ways to start learning ES6 is to be forced to put it to immediate use. This site has 70+ pages worth of unit tests which are all broken. You'll correct the ES6 JavaScript code to fix those tests and in the process learn lots about using it.
